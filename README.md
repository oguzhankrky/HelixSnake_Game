# Project Purpose
The goal of the project is to develop a snake game version which can generate amino acids’ codons.

# General Information
The game is played controlling a moving snake in 25*60 area. There are four letters which are A (Adenine), C (Cytosine), G (Guanine) and T (Thymine) in the game area. The snake starts with 3 letters assigned randomly out of four letter (A, C, G, T). When the snake eats these letters, it becomes longer. If the snake bumps into a wall or its own body the game is over.
# Amino Acids
There are twenty amino acids found in proteins. Amino acids are represented with codons. Each codon contains 3 letter of the DNA coding units T, C, A and G. All 64 possible 3-letter combinations of T, C, A and G are used either to encode one of these amino acids or as one of the three stop codons that signals the end of a sequence.


# Requirements
● “aminoacids.txt” text file 

● EnigmaConsole jar file (In Enigma folder)
